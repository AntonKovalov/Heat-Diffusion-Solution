# Heat-Diffusion-Solution

Lately I have been into numerical simulation and modeling. This is something that actually makes me feel engaged. So now that I have started a CFD course I was specialy motivated to write something. As my first assignment I obtained a one dimensional heat diffusion problem to solve. I believe I have managed to do it successfully, although I know that there is a lot of room for improvement. I don't think I will be returning to this code in order to optimize it, I would rather improve my techniques and algorithms through tackeling further problems. However, I would be extremely pleased if someone would find intrest in enhencing the code.
